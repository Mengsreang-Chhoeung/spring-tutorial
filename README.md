## Sample Application with Spring Boot

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
public class DemoApplication {

    @GetMapping("/helloworld")
    public String hello() {
        return"Hello World!";
    }
}
```

## What is Spring

Spring is a mature, powerful and highly flexible framework focused on building web applications in Java.

One of the core benefits of Spring is that it takes care of most of the low-level aspects of building the application to allow us to actually focus on features and business logic.

Another strong point is that, while the framework is quite mature and well-established, it's very actively maintained and has a thriving dev community. This makes it quite up to date and aligned with the Java ecosystem right now.

It was **developed** by **Rod Johnson** in `2003`.
